# MessageWarehouse

This repository consists of a simple smart contract for practicing basic concepts in this environment, such as using modifiers and events with functions, learning how to use Remix IDE, and deploying and testing smart contracts locally.

## Features
I have developed a message warehouse, where the user can interact with a message using a password:

- 📖 Read message: with this function the user can read the actual stored message, but the password will be needed.
- 📩 Send message: function with two arguments, the password for checking if the action can be executed and the message that will be send.
- ❌ Delete message: if the password is correct, the actual message stored in the warehouse will be deleted.
